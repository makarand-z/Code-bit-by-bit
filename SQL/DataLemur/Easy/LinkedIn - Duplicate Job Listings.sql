-- step 1 - grouping job listings by job title, job_id and description

SELECT company_id, 
title,
description,
count(job_id) AS job_count
FROM job_listings
GROUP BY company_id, title, description;

-- step 2 - filtering for job_count > 1 (unique job listings) using above query as a subquery

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM (
  SELECT company_id, 
  title,
  description,
  count(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY company_id, title, description
) AS jobs_grouped
WHERE job_count > 1;
