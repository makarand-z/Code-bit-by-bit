/*
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs � whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is identified by the case_id column.

If you like this question, try out Patient Support Analysis (Part 2)!

callers Table:
Column Name	Type
policy_holder_id	integer
case_id	varchar
call_category	varchar
call_date	timestamp
call_duration_secs	integer

callers Example Input:
policy_holder_id	case_id	call_category	call_date	call_duration_secs
1	f1d012f9-9d02-4966-a968-bf6c5bc9a9fe	emergency assistance	2023-04-13T19:16:53Z	144
1	41ce8fb6-1ddd-4f50-ac31-07bfcce6aaab	authorisation	2023-05-25T09:09:30Z	815

Example Output:
policy_holder_count
1

Explanation:
The only caller who made three, or more calls is policy holder ID 2.

-- step 1 - filtering out policy holders who callled three or more times

SELECT policy_holder_id,
COUNT(case_id) AS call_count
FROM callers
GROUP BY policy_holder_id
HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3;

-- step 2 - finding count of policy holders using above query as subquery

SELECT COUNT(policy_holder_id) AS policy_holder_count
FROM (
  SELECT policy_holder_id,
  COUNT(case_id) AS call_count
  FROM callers
  GROUP BY policy_holder_id
  HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3
) AS records;
